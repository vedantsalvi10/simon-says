This is my second javascript project which actually works as a game. In this you have to a sequence and as the level increases difficulty also increases.<br>

<h2>How To play the game:</h2><br><br>
<h3>note:</h3> You will require a keyboard to play this game.<br>
<h3> step 1:</h3> press any key to start.<br><br><br>
<img src ="/images/start.png" alt="start of the game"/>
<br>
step 2: Out of four one block will blink.<br><br>
step 3: Click the block that blinks <br><br><br>
<img src ="/images/level.png" alt="level of the game"/><br>
