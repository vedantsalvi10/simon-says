This is my second javascript project which actually works as a game. In this you have to a sequence and as the level increases difficulty also increases.<br>

<h2>How To play the game:</h2><br><br>
<h3>note:</h3> You will require a keyboard to play this game.<br>
<h3> step 1:</h3> press any key to start.<br><br><br>

<br>
<h3>step 2:</h3> Out of four one block will blink.<br><br>
<h3>step 3:</h3> Click the block that blinks <br><br><br>
<img src ="/images/level.png" alt="level of the game"/><br>
<h3>step 4:</h3>after clicking the block, out of four another block will blink.<br><br>
<h3>step 5:</h3> Click the previous block that you clicked and then click the block that just blinked.<br><br>
<h3>step 6:</h3>At each level a new block will blink then you have to click all the previous blocks and then click the new block<br><br>
<h3>Note:</h3> If you click wrong block then game over will appear<br><br>
<h3>step 7:</h3> If that appears then press any key to start the game again.<br><br><br>
