This is my second javascript project which actually works as a game. In this you have to a sequence and as the level increases difficulty also increases.<br>

<h2>How To play the game:</h2><br>
note: You will require a keyboard to play this game.<br>
step 1: press any key to start.<br>
<img src ="/images/start.png" alt="start of the game"/>
<br>
step 2: Out of four one block will blink.<br>
